We conducted an analysis of the non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the Coronavirus Vaccine Efficacy (COVE) study, and demonstrated that they were a valid negative control outcome (NCO) for COVID-19 using data from the blinded phase. In the study's open-label extension, we used non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections to detect bias in estimates of vaccine efficacy waning. Our results have implications for the ensuring robustness of non-randomized analyses of COVID-19 vaccines from observational studies and secondary analyses of vaccine trial data.

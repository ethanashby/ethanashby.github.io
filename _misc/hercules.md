As part of UW Biostat course, we authored a mock protocol for an original clinical trial comparing a novel anti-HER2 cancer vaccine (HER-Vaxx) plus chemotherapy to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of advanced/metastatic HER2-posite Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma. You can find the protocol [here](/files/hercules.pdf) along with a short [slide deck](/files/HERCULES Primer.pdf).

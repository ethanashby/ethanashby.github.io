This is Ethan Ashby's personal research website. I am a PhD student at the University of Washington in Biostatistics in the School of Public Health. I graduated with a BA in Mathematics from Pomona College. My research is supported financially through the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Grant.

My research interests lie in developing and leveraging statistical methods to advance vaccine science, particularly for COVID-19 and HIV-1 vaccines. I am broadly interested in the causal inference, survival analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, and interference.

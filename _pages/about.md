This is Ethan Ashby's personal research website. I am a PhD student at the University of Washington in Biostatistics in the School of Public Health. I graduated with a BA in Mathematics from Pomona College . My research is supported financially through the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Grant.

My research work focuses on secondary analyses of clinical trials related to HIV/COVID vaccines. I also have experience working on a variety of high-dimensional 'Omics analyses. I am broadly interested in the field of causal inference with applications to estimating treatment effect heterogeneity, survival analysis, and immune correlates of protection.
